# Kaggle_ML Project #1 Loan Status Prediction

**Overview**:
A finance company aims to streamline its loan approval process by automating the evaluation of loan applications. To achieve this, the company seeks to develop a machine learning system that assesses various applicant details—such as educational background, marital status, and graduation status—submitted through an online form. This system will analyze the information provided to determine whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. The goal is to make loan approvals more efficient and accurate, ensuring that eligible applicants receive loans quickly while minimizing the risk of default.

We aim to develop a machine learning-based system to automate the loan approval process for a finance company. By leveraging a Support Vector Machine model trained on pre-processed applicant data, including critical financial indicators like annual income, the system will predict and classify loan eligibility with improved accuracy and efficiency. This approach intends to replace manual assessments with an automated, reliable solution to expedite decision-making and reduce potential bias in loan approvals.

# Kaggle_ML Project #2 Breast Cancer Classification

**Overview**:
Our project aims to classify breast tumors as either benign or malignant using a dataset that contains detailed information about these tumors. Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body and are generally not harmful, while malignant tumors can metastasize, meaning they can spread to other organs and are cancerous. Early and accurate detection of malignant tumors is crucial for timely treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation. This classification will help in identifying patients who need immediate medical attention.

We will start by collecting and reviewing the breast cancer dataset. After collecting the data, we will preprocess it to make it suitable for our machine learning model. This involves cleaning and standardizing the data. Next, we will split the data into training and testing sets. We will train a logistic regression model using the training data, as this model is effective for binary classification tasks like distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. After training, we will evaluate the model's performance using the test data. Finally, we will use the trained model to predict whether new tumors are benign or malignant.

# Kaggle_ML Project #3 Diabetes Prediction

**Overview**:
This project aims to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict diabetes using patient medical information, such as blood glucose levels, insulin levels, and BMI. By preprocessing and standardizing the data, and then training the SVM classifier, we can accurately classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic. This model will help in early detection and management of diabetes based on medical data.

We will train our model using diabetes data and their respective labels (diabetic or non-diabetic). First, we preprocess the data by standardizing it to ensure all medical information is in the same range. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate our model's performance. We will then train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the training data to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Once trained, the SVM model can predict whether new patients are diabetic or non-diabetic based on their medical information.

# Kaggle_ML Project #5 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

**Overview**:
This project aims to create a machine learning system that predicts the medical insurance cost for individuals based on their personal data. The system will learn from historical data, including factors such as age, gender, BMI, and medical history, to accurately estimate insurance costs. By automating this process, the insurance company can efficiently determine the appropriate pricing for each person. This approach will help in making data-driven decisions, improving accuracy, and saving time for the company.

First, we collect the insurance cost data, including relevant parameters like health issues and gender. Next, we analyze the data to understand its significance and relationships through various plots and graphs. We then preprocess the data to make it suitable for the machine learning model. After preprocessing, we split the data into training and testing sets. We use the training data to train a linear regression model and evaluate its performance with the test data. Once trained, the model can predict insurance costs for new data, providing accurate estimates.
