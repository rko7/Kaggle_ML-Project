# Kaggle_ML Project #1 Loan Status Prediction

**Overview**:<br>
A finance company aims to streamline its loan approval process by automating the evaluation of loan applications. To achieve this, the company seeks to develop a machine learning system that assesses various applicant details—such as educational background, marital status, and graduation status—submitted through an online form. This system will analyze the information provided to determine whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. The goal is to make loan approvals more efficient and accurate, ensuring that eligible applicants receive loans quickly while minimizing the risk of default.<br>
<br>
We aim to develop a machine learning-based system to automate the loan approval process for a finance company. By leveraging a Support Vector Machine model trained on pre-processed applicant data, including critical financial indicators like annual income, the system will predict and classify loan eligibility with improved accuracy and efficiency. This approach intends to replace manual assessments with an automated, reliable solution to expedite decision-making and reduce potential bias in loan approvals.

# Kaggle_ML Project #2 Breast Cancer Classification

**Overview**:<br>
Our project aims to classify breast tumors as either benign or malignant using a dataset that contains detailed information about these tumors. Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body and are generally not harmful, while malignant tumors can metastasize, meaning they can spread to other organs and are cancerous. Early and accurate detection of malignant tumors is crucial for timely treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation. This classification will help in identifying patients who need immediate medical attention.<br>
<br>
We will start by collecting and reviewing the breast cancer dataset. After collecting the data, we will preprocess it to make it suitable for our machine learning model. This involves cleaning and standardizing the data. Next, we will split the data into training and testing sets. We will train a logistic regression model using the training data, as this model is effective for binary classification tasks like distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. After training, we will evaluate the model's performance using the test data. Finally, we will use the trained model to predict whether new tumors are benign or malignant.

# Kaggle_ML Project #3 Diabetes Prediction

**Overview**:<br>
This project aims to develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict diabetes using patient medical information, such as blood glucose levels, insulin levels, and BMI. By preprocessing and standardizing the data, and then training the SVM classifier, we can accurately classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic. This model will help in early detection and management of diabetes based on medical data.<br>
<br>
We will train our model using diabetes data and their respective labels (diabetic or non-diabetic). First, we preprocess the data by standardizing it to ensure all medical information is in the same range. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate our model's performance. We will then train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the training data to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Once trained, the SVM model can predict whether new patients are diabetic or non-diabetic based on their medical information.

# Kaggle_ML Project #4 Car Price Prediction

**Overview**:<br>
Our project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as Car Brand, Model Year, Selling Price, Present Price, Kilometers Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission Type, and Number of Owners. By analyzing this dataset, we will train a machine learning model to identify patterns and relationships between these factors and the car prices. The trained model will be able to predict the selling price of a used car when provided with new data. This will help in accurately estimating the value of used cars in the market.<br>
<br>
We will begin by collecting the car data necessary for our machine learning model. After obtaining the dataset, we will preprocess it to make it suitable for the algorithm, ensuring the data is clean and standardized. Next, we will split the data into training and testing sets to train our model and evaluate its performance. We will use two regression models, Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, to train the model and compare their accuracy. Once trained, the model will predict car prices based on new data inputs. This process will enable us to predict the selling prices of used cars effectively

# Kaggle_ML Project #5 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

**Overview**:<br>
This project aims to create a machine learning system that predicts the medical insurance cost for individuals based on their personal data. The system will learn from historical data, including factors such as age, gender, BMI, and medical history, to accurately estimate insurance costs. By automating this process, the insurance company can efficiently determine the appropriate pricing for each person. This approach will help in making data-driven decisions, improving accuracy, and saving time for the company.<br>
<br>
First, we collect the insurance cost data, including relevant parameters like health issues and gender. Next, we analyze the data to understand its significance and relationships through various plots and graphs. We then preprocess the data to make it suitable for the machine learning model. After preprocessing, we split the data into training and testing sets. We use the training data to train a linear regression model and evaluate its performance with the test data. Once trained, the model can predict insurance costs for new data, providing accurate estimates.

# Kaggle_ML Project #7 Heart Disease Prediction: Comparing FLD and RF Models 
**Overview**:<br>
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to predict heart disease in individuals based on their medical data. The dataset used includes over a thousand labeled examples, which classify individuals into two categories: those with heart disease and those without. Our aim is to employ Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to analyze and predict heart disease effectively. By leveraging these techniques, we intend to enhance the accuracy of heart disease diagnostics, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in early detection and timely treatment.<br>
<br>
The process begins by preparing the dataset, which involves cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The FLD and RF models are then trained on the processed data. We evaluate these models based on several metrics including training and testing times, accuracy, and through confusion matrices that provide insights into the classification errors made by the models. The performance evaluation of these models involves comparing their predictive accuracies and the time they take to train and predict, enabling us to determine the most effective approach for heart disease prediction. This analytical method not only enhances our understanding of the predictive capabilities of each model but also supports the healthcare sector by providing a reliable decision-support tool for early disease diagnosis.
